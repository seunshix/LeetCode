'''

Time complexity : O(nlogn)

Other than the sort invocation, we do a simple linear scan of the list, so the runtime is dominated by the O(nlogn) complexity of sorting.

Space complexity : O(logN) (or O(n))

If we can sort intervals in place, we do not need more than constant additional space, although the sorting itself takes O(logn) space. Otherwise, we must allocate linear space to store a copy of intervals and sort that.
